Confluent Cloud offers pre-built, fully managed link:https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/connectors/index.html[connectors] that make it easy to quickly connect to popular data sources and end systems in the cloud.
However, if you want to stream specific events that don't have an available connector in Confluent Cloud, you can run your own connector and send the data to your Kafka cluster.
This tutorial shows how you can run your own connector locally.
