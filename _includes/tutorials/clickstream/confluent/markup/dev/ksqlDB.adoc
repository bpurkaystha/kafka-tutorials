This tutorial creates simulated data with the `Datagen` connector.
Then you can process the data in a variety of ways by enriching the clickstream data with user information, analyze errors, aggregate data into windows of time, etc.
  
Optional: To simulate a real-world scenario where user sessions aren't just always open but do close after some time, you can pause and resume the `DATAGEN_CLICKSTREAM` connector.
